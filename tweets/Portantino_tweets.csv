1008436236044734469,2018-06-17 19:48:29+00:00,0,0,@mwsanford I’m sorry u feel it necessary to compare this heartless separation to other injustices and consequences as an attempt to find a moral equivalence.  Taking these children from their parents is just wrong by any Christian or ethical standard.

1008405610923110400,2018-06-17 17:46:47+00:00,19,0,"As I wishwell all dads I’m concerned about children being harmed by mean agenda. decency is not partisan.  Noone should feel good we should demand a change to separation policy. StFrancis said “Preach the Gospel at all times. When necessary, use words” Let’s all, me included, try"
